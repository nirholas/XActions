# Story 3.4: Operation persistence + Socket.IO updates

Status: done

## Story

As a dashboard user of XActions,
I want Facebook automation jobs tracked in the database with real-time progress,
so that I can monitor long-running jobs and review their history.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1 — Operation record lifecycle**
1. When a real (`dryRun: false`) Facebook automation runs, an `Operation` record is created with `status: 'running'` before the browser launches.
2. On success: record updated to `status: 'completed'`, `completedAt` set, `result` JSON-stringified.
3. On failure: record updated to `status: 'failed'`, `completedAt` set, `error` message stored.
4. Dry-run previews do NOT create Operation records — they are ephemeral by design.

**AC2 — userId scoping**
5. Every Operation record is created with `userId: req.user.id` (from JWT auth).
6. No cross-user read/write — authMiddleware on all routes enforces this at the boundary.

**AC3 — Socket.IO events**
7. `facebook:operation` events emitted on `global.io` for start, complete, and error transitions.
8. Each event payload includes `{ event, operationId, userId, type/status, ... }`.
9. Cookie values are never included in Operation config, result, or Socket.IO payloads (NFR3).

**AC4 — Existing Operation model reused**
10. No new Prisma model or migration — `Operation` model from `prisma/schema.prisma` is used as-is.
11. `type` field uses `facebook_${action}` convention (e.g. `facebook_like`, `facebook_post`).
12. `config` stores `{ action, urls, text, maxBatch }` — authCookie intentionally excluded (NFR3).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add Prisma import to `api/routes/facebook.js`**
  - [x] `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'`
  - [x] `const prisma = new PrismaClient()`

- [x] **Task 2: Wrap automate handler with Operation lifecycle** (AC: 1–3)
  - [x] Create Operation before browser launch (real runs only)
  - [x] Emit `facebook:operation` start event via `global.io`
  - [x] Update Operation to `completed` + emit complete event on success
  - [x] Update Operation to `failed` + emit error event on browserError, then re-throw
  - [x] Include `operationId` in successful response JSON

- [x] **Task 3: Artifact + commit** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Reuse existing `Operation` model — no Prisma migration needed
  - [x] Document NFR3 authCookie exclusion in config field

### Completion Notes List

✅ **Story 3.4 Implementation Complete** (Date: 2026-06-10)

**Implemented in `api/routes/facebook.js`:**
- Prisma import + `const prisma = new PrismaClient()`
- Operation record created for real writes only (`resolvedDryRun === false`)
- try/catch/finally restructured: inner catch updates Operation on failure + re-throws
- `global.io?.emit('facebook:operation', { event, operationId, userId, ... })` on all transitions
- `operationId` included in response JSON (null for dry-run)
- authCookie never in `config` field — NFR3 compliant

**No Prisma migration required** — existing `Operation` model sufficient.

**Deferred:**
- Selector verification on real Facebook sessions (Epic 2 deferred item)
- Room-based Socket.IO delivery (`io.to('user:${userId}')`) deferred; current broadcast with userId in payload is safe

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `api/routes/facebook.js` — Prisma import + Operation lifecycle in automate handler
