## X/Twitter Launch Thread

Post each block as a separate tweet in a thread.

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

just shipped the biggest update to XActions ever

58,000+ lines of new code. 115 new files.

XActions is now the most complete open-source X/Twitter toolkit on GitHub.

plugins. workflows. cross-platform. real-time streaming. social graphs. sentiment analysis. browser extension.

all free. thread 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (Plugin System)**

1/ Plugin System

anyone can now extend XActions with npm packages

create xactions-plugin-yourname → add scrapers, MCP tools, automations, API routes

community plugins auto-register in the MCP server so AI agents discover them instantly

---

**Tweet 3 (Cross-Platform)**

2/ Cross-Platform Scrapers

XActions now scrapes Bluesky, Mastodon, and Threads — not just Twitter

Bluesky uses AT Protocol (no browser needed)
Mastodon uses public REST API (any instance)
Threads uses Puppeteer like Twitter

one unified interface:
scrape('bluesky', 'profile', { username: 'user.bsky.social' })

---

**Tweet 4 (Workflows)**

3/ Workflow Engine

define automation pipelines as JSON:

trigger: every 30 min
→ scrape @competitor's latest tweet
→ if posted < 30 min ago
→ summarize with AI
→ post your take

set it and forget it. runs on cron via Bull queue.

---

**Tweet 5 (Streaming)**

4/ Real-Time Streaming

subscribe to any account's tweets, follower changes, or mentions

polls via Puppeteer → deduplicates in Redis → pushes events over Socket.IO

your dashboard updates live. no API key. no webhook setup.

---

**Tweet 6 (Sentiment + Graph)**

5/ Sentiment Analysis + Social Graph

built-in sentiment analyzer works completely offline — no API keys

monitor your reputation over time. get alerts when sentiment drops.

plus: map your entire social graph. find clusters, bridge accounts, influence scores. export to D3.js or Gephi.

---

**Tweet 7 (Portability)**

6/ Account Portability

export your ENTIRE Twitter life:
- all tweets
- followers & following lists
- bookmarks & likes
- DMs

formats: JSON, CSV, Markdown, self-contained HTML archive

migration stubs ready for Bluesky & Mastodon

---

**Tweet 8 (Extension)**

7/ Browser Extension

no more pasting scripts in the console

Chrome/Firefox extension with a popup UI:
- toggle automations on/off
- configure settings
- live activity log
- works on x.com, standalone, no server needed

---

**Tweet 9 (Numbers)**

140+ MCP tools (most of any Twitter MCP server)
4 platforms (Twitter, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads)
50+ browser scripts
29 API route modules
26 agent skills
22 Claude tutorials
6 new systems (plugins, streaming, workflows, analytics, portability, graph)

---

**Tweet 10 (CTA)**

all of this is 100% free and open source.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: XActions – Open-source X/Twitter automation with MCP, cross-platform scrapers, and workflow engine

**Text:**

Hey HN,

I've been building XActions — an open-source toolkit for X/Twitter automation. Just shipped v3.1.0 with some features I haven't seen in any other project:

- **Plugin system** — community npm packages that extend scrapers, MCP tools, and automations
- **Cross-platform scrapers** — Twitter + Bluesky (AT Protocol) + Mastodon (REST API) + Threads behind one interface
- **Workflow engine** — declarative JSON pipelines with cron triggers, conditions, and chained actions
- **Real-time streaming** — subscribe to tweet/follower/mention events via Socket.IO polling
- **Social graph analysis** — map relationships, detect clusters, find bridge accounts with D3.js visualization
- **140+ MCP tools** — largest free MCP server for Twitter, works with Claude/GPT/Cursor
- **Sentiment analysis** — built-in rule-based analyzer (works offline) + optional LLM mode
- **Account portability** — export your entire Twitter life to JSON/CSV/HTML, migration stubs for Bluesky

Everything runs via browser scripts (paste in console), CLI, Node.js library, or MCP server for AI agents. No Twitter API key needed — it uses Puppeteer with stealth mode.

GitHub: https://github.com/nirholas/XActions
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xactions

100% MIT licensed. Would love feedback on the architecture, especially the plugin system and workflow engine.
