### 2. Content Repurposing Pipeline

For every blog post published, create a distribution flow:

├── Reddit post (next day, relevant subreddit)
├── Dev.to cross-post (with canonical URL, 2 days later)
├── LinkedIn post (3 days later)
├── YouTube script outline (for video content)
├── Newsletter section (weekly digest)
├── GitHub Discussion (link + discussion prompt)
└── Community shares (relevant Discords, Slacks)
```

For each platform, show:
- Format adaptation (how to transform blog → platform-native content)
- Timing relative to publish date
- Templates/patterns to follow
- Links back to original (for SEO juice)

Provide 30 days of specific social posts across all platforms.
