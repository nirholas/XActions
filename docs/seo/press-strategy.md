# Press & Coverage Strategy for XActions

> How to get independent, third-party coverage of XActions — the key ingredient for Wikipedia notability and Google Knowledge Panel eligibility.

---

## Why Independent Coverage Matters

Google requires **independent, reliable sources** to confirm entity notability. Self-published content (your own blog, README, tweets) doesn't count. You need:

- Articles ABOUT XActions written by someone else
- Reviews, mentions, or features in recognized publications
- Citations in developer resources and newsletters

This is also a prerequisite for a Wikipedia article (which requires 3+ independent reliable sources).

## Content Strategy: Create Shareable Assets

Before pitching press, create content that journalists and bloggers naturally want to cover.

### High-Coverage-Potential Angles

| Angle | Why It Works | Target Publications |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Free alternative to Twitter's $100/mo API" | Cost-saving, anti-big-tech narrative | TechCrunch, The Verge, Hacker News |
| "MCP server lets AI agents control Twitter" | AI trend, novel capability | AI newsletters, dev blogs |
| "Open-source tool lets you mass unfollow on Twitter" | Practical, high-search-volume problem | How-to blogs, YouTube tutorials |
| "Browser automation replaces expensive APIs" | Technical innovation angle | JavaScript Weekly, Node Weekly |
| "One developer built a complete Twitter toolkit" | Indie hacker / builder story | Indie Hackers, r/SideProject |
| "Why I open-sourced my Twitter automation tool" | Philosophy + technical story | Dev.to, Hashnode, freeCodeCamp |

### Assets to Create Before Pitching

- [ ] **Demo video** (60-90 seconds) — Screen recording of XActions running
- [ ] **Comparison chart** — XActions vs Twitter API vs Hypefury vs Tweethunter
- [ ] **Stats/numbers** — GitHub stars, npm downloads, features count, time saved
- [ ] **One-page press kit** — Logo, description, screenshots, key facts, founder bio
- [ ] **Quotable founder bio** — "nich is a developer and open-source advocate who built XActions to democratize Twitter automation"

## Tier 1: Self-Published (Build Foundation)

Write these yourself to establish initial content presence. These don't count as "independent" for Wikipedia, but they:
- Rank in Google for XActions-related queries
- Provide source material for journalists
- Build SEO backlinks

### Articles to Write

| Platform | Title | Target Keywords |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Dev.to** | "How I Replaced Twitter's $100/mo API with Browser Automation" | twitter api alternative, browser automation |
| **Dev.to** | "Building an MCP Server for Twitter — The Complete Guide" | mcp server twitter, model context protocol |
| **Hashnode** | "Mass Unfollow on Twitter/X: The 2026 Developer's Guide" | mass unfollow twitter, twitter unfollow tool |
| **Medium** | "XActions: Open-Source Twitter Automation Without API Keys" | twitter automation open source |
| **freeCodeCamp** | "How to Automate Twitter with JavaScript (No API Required)" | twitter bot javascript, automate twitter |
| **LogRocket Blog** | "Advanced Browser Automation Patterns with Puppeteer" | puppeteer automation, browser scraping |
| **Smashing Magazine** | "Building Developer Tools: Lessons from XActions" | building dev tools, open source startup |

### Cross-Posting Rules
- Always set `canonical_url` to the original post
- Publish on your blog first, then cross-post to Dev.to/Hashnode 3 days later
- Each platform gets a slightly different intro paragraph

## Outreach Templates

### Newsletter Submission Email

```
Subject: XActions — Free, Open-Source X/Twitter Automation (No API Required)

Hi [Editor Name],

XActions is an open-source X/Twitter automation toolkit that replaces Twitter's
$100/mo API with browser automation. It includes:

- Mass unfollow non-followers
- Profile/tweet/follower scraping
- MCP server for AI agents (Claude, GPT-4)
- CLI tool and npm library
- Auto-liker, auto-follow, monitoring

It's 100% free, MIT licensed, and runs locally — no API keys or fees.

GitHub: https://github.com/nirholas/XActions
Website: https://xactions.app
npm: https://npmjs.com/package/xactions

Happy to provide more details, screenshots, or a demo.

Best,
nich (@nichxbt)
```

### YouTube Creator Pitch

```
Subject: Video idea — Free Twitter automation without the API

Hey [Creator Name],

I built an open-source toolkit that does everything Twitter's $100/mo API does —
for free. It runs in the browser console or Node.js.

What makes it interesting for your audience:
1. People paste JavaScript into DevTools and it just works
2. It has an MCP server so you can give Claude/GPT access to Twitter
3. Zero API fees — browser automation instead of API calls
4. MIT licensed, [X] GitHub stars

Would make a great "build with me" or tool review video.

Demo: [link to 60-second demo video]
GitHub: https://github.com/nirholas/XActions

Cheers,
nich
```
