**Site Architecture:**
- URL structure patterns
- Number of indexed pages (estimate)
- Content types (blog posts, feature pages, comparison pages, etc.)
- Use of subdomains vs subdirectories

**On-Page SEO:**
- Title tag patterns/formulas they use
- Meta description patterns
- Heading structure approach
- Content length averages for key pages
- Schema markup they likely use

**Content Strategy:**
- Do they have a blog? How active?
- Types of content: guides, comparisons, listicles, tutorials?
- Topic focus areas
- Estimated content production rate

**Keyword Strategy:**
- What keywords they likely target on their homepage

- "vs" and "alternative" keywords they target
- Long-tail keywords they capture

**Technical SEO:**
- Tech stack (Next.js, WordPress, custom?)

### 2. SERP Landscape Analysis

For these high-value search queries, describe what the SERP looks like:
1. "mass unfollow twitter"
2. "twitter automation tool"
3. "unfollow non followers twitter"
4. "twitter bot free"
5. "download twitter video"
6. "twitter scraper"
7. "auto like twitter"
8. "twitter api alternative"
9. "who unfollowed me on twitter"
10. "twitter growth tool"
11. "mcp server twitter"
12. "ai twitter automation"

For each:
- What type of results dominate (tools, articles, how-to guides)?
- Are there featured snippets? What format?
- Are there "People Also Ask" boxes? What questions?
- Are there video results?
- Who currently ranks in top 5?
- Opportunity level for XActions (low/medium/high)

### 3. Competitive Content Gaps

Identify content types/pages that competitors have but XActions doesn't:
- Comparison/vs pages ("X vs Y")
- "Alternative to" pages
- Use case pages
- Industry/niche pages
- Integration pages
- Blog posts / SEO content
- Free tool pages (e.g., "free twitter follower count" tool page)
- Resource pages / glossary

### 4. Link Profile Analysis

For top 5 competitors, estimate:
- Domain authority range
- Types of backlinks they likely have (product directories, blog mentions, GitHub, etc.)
- Link acquisition strategies they use
- XActions' advantages for link building (open source, GitHub, npm)

### 5. Competitive Advantage Matrix

Create a matrix showing:
| Feature/Ranking Factor | XActions | Hypefury | TweetHunter | Circleboom | Tweepy |
|----------------------|----------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Price | ✅ Free | ❌ $29/mo | ❌ $49/mo | ... | ... |
| Content volume | ? | ? | ? | ... | ... |
| Schema markup | ? | ? | ? | ... | ... |
| Blog/content | ? | ? | ? | ... | ... |
| etc. | | | | | |
