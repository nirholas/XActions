## Phase 1: Foundation (Now → 500 Stars)

### 1.1 GitHub Optimization (Do TODAY)

**Topics** — Update to max 20 high-traffic topics:
```

model-context-protocol, nodejs, open-source, puppeteer, twitter, 
twitter-automation, twitter-bot, twitter-scraper, unfollow-tool, 
x, xactions, scraper, social-media
```

**Description** — Keep current (it's good). Under 350 chars with keywords front-loaded.

**License** — Fix the "NOASSERTION" license display. Add/verify the LICENSE file is a proper MIT license file so GitHub renders it correctly.

### 1.3 Twitter/X Growth (Your Home Turf)

**Viral Tweet Templates:**

```
I stopped paying $100/mo for Twitter's API.

Built an open-source toolkit that does everything the API does — for free.

Scrapers, automation, MCP server for AI agents, CLI.

No API keys. No monthly fees. Just works.

⭐ github.com/nirholas/xactions
```

```
You don't need Twitter's API to:
→ Unfollow non-followers
→ Scrape any profile
→ Auto-like by keyword
→ Download videos
→ Monitor accounts

Just open DevTools and paste 10 lines of JavaScript.

100% free. 100% open source.

github.com/nirholas/xactions
```

```
Twitter charges $100/mo for their API.

Here's what I built for $0:

✅ Profile scraper
✅ Followers/following scraper
✅ Tweet search & scrape
✅ Video downloader
✅ Mass unfollow tool
✅ Auto-liker
✅ MCP server for AI agents
✅ CLI + npm library

All open source. All free.

Star it: github.com/nirholas/xactions
```

**Posting cadence:** 3-5x/week about XActions. Mix:
- Demo videos (screen recordings of scripts running)
- "Before XActions vs After" comparisons
- User testimonials / DMs (ask permission)
- Feature announcements
- Tutorial threads
