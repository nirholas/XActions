> Paste this entire prompt into a new Claude Opus 4.6 chat.

---

## Context

I run **XActions** (https://xactions.app), a free, open-source X/Twitter automation toolkit. I need a comprehensive backlink acquisition strategy. As an open-source project, I have unique link building advantages that SaaS competitors don't.

### Our Link Building Assets
- **Open source on GitHub** (github.com/nirholas/xactions) — star count, contributors
- **NPM package** (npm install xactions) — download stats
- **MIT License** — anyone can use/mention
- **Free tool** — easy to recommend
- **MCP Server** — AI/LLM integration (trending tech)
- **43+ features** — many hook angles
- **Author presence** on X/Twitter (@nichxbt)
- **Technical content** — developer audience loves sharing

### Current Backlinks (Limited)
- GitHub profile/repo links
- NPM listing
- Likely some Twitter mentions
- No systematic link building done

### Domain Age
- Relatively new domain (xactions.app)
- Need to build domain authority from near-zero

For each channel, provide specific, actionable tactics:

**A. Developer Community Links (High Priority)**
- GitHub Awesome Lists — which lists to submit to?

- Product Hunt — launch strategy
- GitHub trending — how to get there

**B. Open Source Directories & Listings**

- Submission requirements for each
- Expected link value (dofollow/nofollow, DA)

**C. Tool Aggregator Sites**
- AlternativeTo
- G2
- Capterra (for free tools)
- ToolFinder, SaaSHub
- List 20+ relevant aggregator sites

**F. Social Proof Links**

### 2. Link-Worthy Content Assets

Design **5 linkable assets** — content specifically created to attract backlinks:

**Asset 1: "State of Twitter Automation 2026" Report**
- Annual report/infographic about Twitter automation trends
- Data-driven (scrape/compile public data)
- Journalists and bloggers link to reports

**Asset 2: "Twitter Automation Toolkit Comparison" Interactive Page**
- Comprehensive comparison of all tools
- Honest (not just biased toward XActions)
- Tables, scores, filters
- People link to comprehensive comparisons

**Asset 3: "Free Twitter API" Developer Resource**
- Position XActions as the free Twitter API alternative
- Documentation, code examples, SDKs
- Developer community will share/link

**Asset 4: Open Source Contribution Guide**
- Make it super easy to contribute
- Good first issues labeled
- Hacktoberfest participation
- Contributor recognition page

**Asset 5: "[Topic] Statistics & Data"**
- Twitter unfollower statistics
- Twitter automation usage stats
- Original data/research that bloggers cite

### 3. Outreach Templates

Write **10 outreach email/DM templates** for:
1. Guest post pitch
2. Tool directory submission
3. "Alternative to" page inclusion
4. Broken link replacement
5. Resource page inclusion
6. Blogger review request
7. Podcast appearance pitch
8. YouTube collaborator pitch
9. Newsletter mention request
10. Developer community announcement

Each template:
- Subject line
- Body (personalized structure with [VARIABLE] placeholders)
- Follow-up email (if no response in 7 days)
- Best practices for each type

### 4. Competitor Backlink Reverse Engineering

For these competitors, list the types of backlinks they likely have:
- Hypefury
- TweetHunter
- Circleboom
- Typefully

For each:
- Common link sources (what sites link to them?)
- Link types (editorial, directory, review, etc.)
- Which of these can XActions replicate?
- Which can XActions surpass? (open-source angle gives us access to developer-focused links they can't get)

### 5. Link Building Scorecard

| Channel | Effort | Timeline | Est. Links/Mo | Link Quality | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
