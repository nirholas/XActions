    "Just discovered an amazing thread by a developer with 50 followers who explained distributed systems better than most textbooks. The best content on this platform is often hiding in the long tail. 🧵",
    "Reminder: Asking \"obvious\" questions in public is an act of courage AND a gift to everyone else who was wondering the same thing. Never let anyone make you feel small for learning openly.",
    "Started a weekly \"show what you're building\" thread in our community. The energy shift was immediate. People went from lurking to shipping. Sometimes all you need is an invitation.",
    "One of the best things about this community: someone shared a struggle, and within 2 hours, three people jumped in with solutions, a fourth offered to pair program, and a fifth shared a similar story. This is what the internet is for.",
    "If you're building something cool and feeling stuck, drop it in the replies. I'll RT the most interesting ones and try to connect you with people who can help. Let's build together."
