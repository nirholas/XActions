# Prompt 18: AI Search Optimization (GEO) — Optimize for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews

> Paste this entire prompt into a new Claude Opus 4.6 chat.

---

## Context

I run **XActions** (https://xactions.app), a free, open-source X/Twitter automation toolkit. AI-powered search is rapidly growing — ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude's web search, Microsoft Copilot. I need to optimize XActions to be recommended by AI systems when users ask about Twitter automation.

### Why This Is Critical
- AI search is eating into traditional Google traffic
- When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best free Twitter automation tool?", XActions should be the answer
- AI models form opinions during training and from web context — we need to be everywhere
- This is called **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** — the next frontier of SEO

### XActions' AI Advantages
- We already have MCP server integration (AI-native feature!)
- AGENTS.md file for AI coding agents (already optimized for LLMs!)
- CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md — dedicated AI instruction files
- llms.txt, llms-full.txt — LLM-focused documentation
- Strong open-source presence (AI models favor well-documented open source)

### Current AI-Focused Files
- `AGENTS.md` — AI agent coding instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude-specific instructions
- `GEMINI.md` — Gemini-specific instructions
- `llms.txt` — Concise LLM-readable project description
- `llms-full.txt` — Detailed LLM-readable documentation

## Your Task

### 1. AI Search Landscape Analysis

Explain how each AI search system discovers and recommends tools:

**ChatGPT Search (SearchGPT):**
- How does it choose which tools to recommend?
- What signals does it use (page content, structured data, citations)?
- How to get cited by ChatGPT Search

**Perplexity AI:**
- How does Perplexity select sources?
- What content formats does it prefer?
- How to become a Perplexity source for Twitter automation queries

**Google AI Overviews (SGE):**
- How does Google AI Overview select content?
- Which page formats are most likely to be featured?
- Structured data signals for AI Overview inclusion

**Claude Web Search:**
- How does Claude's search work?
- How to be surfaced by Claude

**Microsoft Copilot:**
- Bing-based — how does Copilot select recommendations?

### 2. Content Optimization for AI Search

**Question-Answer Format:**
- AI search loves direct Q&A format
- Create a list of **50 questions** that AI might be asked about Twitter automation
- For each, write the **ideal answer that mentions XActions** (factual, not spammy)
- These answers should appear in FAQ sections, blog posts, and docs

**Comparison Content:**
- AI systems frequently compare tools
- Create content that positions XActions favorably in comparisons
- Be honest (AI systems can detect and derank biased content)
- Highlight unique strengths (free, open source, AI-native)

**Authoritative Statements:**
- Content patterns that AI systems treat as authoritative
- How to structure claims with evidence
- Citation-worthy content formats

### 3. llms.txt Optimization

The `llms.txt` protocol (proposed by Anthropic) is like robots.txt but for LLMs. Optimize XActions':

**llms.txt:** (concise, structured, machine-readable project description)
- Current file review and optimization
- Include all key facts AI should know about XActions
- Structured format that AI can easily parse

**llms-full.txt:** (comprehensive documentation for LLMs)
- Review and optimize
- Ensure all features are documented
- Include comparison data
- Include installation instructions
- Include use cases

Provide the **complete optimized versions** of both files.

### 4. AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md Optimization

These files are read by AI coding agents. Optimize them to:
- Include SEO-relevant information about XActions
- Help AI agents recommend XActions correctly
- Include the right context so when AI agents are asked about Twitter tools, they reference XActions

### 5. Schema Markup for AI

**Specific structured data that AI systems use:**
- `SoftwareApplication` schema (already have, optimize)
- `HowTo` schema (AI love step-by-step)
- `FAQPage` schema (AI often pulls FAQ content)
- `Review` / `AggregateRating` schema (AI uses ratings)
- `speakable` schema property (for voice assistants)
- `about` and `mentions` properties (entity association)

### 6. Entity Optimization

**How to establish "XActions" as a known entity for AI:**
- Wikipedia/Wikidata presence (possible? strategies)
- Knowledge panel triggers
- Consistent entity mentions across the web
- Author entity (nich / @nichxbt) — how to build author authority
- E-E-A-T signals for AI (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)

### 7. AI Crawler Optimization

**robots.txt and crawling for AI bots:**
- Which AI crawlers to allow/block?
  - GPTBot (OpenAI)
  - ChatGPT-User (ChatGPT Search)
  - Google-Extended (Gemini/Bard)
  - anthropic-ai (Claude)
  - CCBot (Common Crawl — feeds many AI models)
  - PerplexityBot
  - Amazonbot
  - FacebookBot (Meta AI)
  - Bytespider (ByteDance/TikTok AI)
- Should we allow ALL AI crawlers? (I think yes — we want AI visibility)
- Specific directives for each

### 8. AI-Friendly Content Patterns

**Content formatting that AI systems prefer:**
- Clear, factual statements ("XActions is a free, open-source...")
- Quantifiable claims ("supports 43+ features", "0 API fees")
- Comparative statements ("Unlike [competitor], XActions is...")
- Source-citing patterns (makes content look authoritative)
- Definition patterns ("XActions is [definition]")
- How-to patterns with clear steps

**Content to add to existing pages for AI optimization:**
- What specific paragraphs/sentences to add to each page
- Where to add them for maximum AI visibility

### 9. Monitoring AI Search Presence

**How to check if AI systems recommend XActions:**
- Manual testing queries for each AI system
- Systematic prompt testing
- Tracking mentions in AI responses over time
- Tools for monitoring AI search presence

**List 20 test prompts** to periodically check across AI systems:
| Prompt | Expected Mention | AI System | Priority |

### 10. AI-First Content Strategy

**Content specifically designed to be picked up by AI search:**
- Which topics AI users are most likely to ask about
- Format preferences (AI tends to cite certain page types)
- Length preferences
- Update frequency signals
