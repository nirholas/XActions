## Context

I run **XActions** (https://xactions.app), an open-source X/Twitter automation toolkit. I need a comprehensive keyword research and mapping strategy to ensure every page targets the right keywords and we capture maximum search traffic.

### What XActions Does
- **Mass Unfollow** non-followers on X/Twitter (most popular feature)
- **Auto-Liker** — automatically like tweets from timeline/lists
- **Auto-Follow** — follow engagers of specific tweets/accounts
- **Detect Unfollowers** — see who unfollowed you
- **Leave All Communities** — bulk leave X communities
- **Video Downloader** — download X/Twitter videos
- **Scrapers** — profile, followers, following, tweets, likes, bookmarks, media, hashtags, lists, notifications, DMs, search results, quote retweets, replies
- **MCP Server** — Model Context Protocol server for AI agents (Claude Desktop, GPT)
- **CLI Tools** — command-line interface for all features
- **Browser Scripts** — paste-and-run in browser console
- **AI API** — pay-per-request API with X-402 payment protocol
- **Real-time Dashboard** — analytics and monitoring

### Current Pages
- Homepage (xactions.app)
- Features page (/features)

## Your Task

### 1. Primary Keyword Map (Page-Level)

For every existing page, assign:
- **Primary keyword** (1 high-volume keyword this page should rank #1 for)
- **Secondary keywords** (3-5 supporting keywords)
- **Long-tail keywords** (5-10 specific phrases)
- **Search intent** (informational, navigational, commercial, transactional)
- **Estimated monthly search volume range** (use your knowledge of SEO volumes)
- **Keyword difficulty assessment** (low/medium/high)
- **SERP feature opportunities** (featured snippet, FAQ rich result, video result, etc.)

### 2. Keyword Gap Analysis

Identify **50+ keywords** we should be ranking for but currently have no dedicated page:
- Group by theme/cluster
- Estimate search volume
- Suggest which existing page could target it OR flag it as needing a new page
- Prioritize by: volume × opportunity × relevance
- Include "vs" keywords (e.g., "xactions vs hypefury")
- Include "alternative to" keywords (e.g., "twitter api alternative")
- Include "how to" keywords
- Include problem-based keywords (e.g., "how to unfollow everyone on twitter")

### 3. Topic Clusters

Design **8-12 topic clusters** with:
- **Pillar page** (main comprehensive page)
- **Cluster pages** (supporting pages linking to/from pillar)
- **Internal linking strategy** for the cluster
- Example:
  - Pillar: "X/Twitter Automation" (/features)
  - Clusters: mass unfollow, auto-liker, scraping, monitoring, etc.

### 4. Long-Tail Keyword Opportunities

Generate **100 long-tail keywords** (4+ words) that XActions could realistically rank for:
- Organized by feature/topic
- Include search intent
- Indicate which page should target each
- Focus on low-competition, high-intent keywords
- Include question-format keywords ("how do I...", "what is...", "can I...")

### 5. Competitor Keyword Gaps

For each major competitor (Hypefury, TweetHunter, Crowdfire, Twitter API), identify:
- 10 keywords they likely rank for that we don't
- Which XActions page could capture that traffic
- Content needed to compete

### 6. Seasonal/Trending Keywords

Identify keywords with seasonal trends or growing search volume:
- AI-related Twitter keywords (growing due to AI hype)
- Twitter/X migration keywords
- "No API" or "free alternative" keywords
- MCP/AI agent keywords (emerging)

### 7. Keyword Priority Matrix

Create a priority matrix combining:
- Search volume
- Competition
- Business relevance
- Quick wins vs long-term plays

Categorize into:
- **Quick wins** (low competition, decent volume, we have a page ready)
- **Strategic targets** (high volume, medium competition, needs content investment)
- **Long shots** (high volume, high competition, aspirational)
- **Niche gems** (low volume, very high intent, easy to rank)

## Output Format

Use tables and structured lists. For each keyword include:
| Keyword | Volume Est. | KD | Intent | Target Page | Action Needed |

At the end, provide a **Top 20 Priority Keywords** list ranked by ROI potential, with specific action items for each.

Be data-driven and specific. Use your training data knowledge of actual search volumes and competition levels. Don't be generic — this is for a specific X/Twitter automation tool.
